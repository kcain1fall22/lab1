  <p>Hi, I am Kevin, my major is ITM, this is my second semester under the tutelage of professor Krieglstein, I am very excited to learn more of the in and outs of web design!</p>
   <ul>
     <li> Some things I have been up to recently </li>
     <li> Reading the classic High fantasy series The Chronicles of Prydain Series by Lloyd Alexander, based on Welsh mythology, 
	      about the adventures of Taran the Assistant Pig-Keeper and his quest to become a hero. It was a recommended fun read by one of my favorite authors Jim Butcher.</li>
     <li> Just came back from a trip in Door county Wisconsin over Labor day weekend, went to the Marina Festival and did some Kayaking</li>
  </ul>
